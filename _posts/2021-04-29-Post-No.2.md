## South Eastern Hedge Fund Competition

During February 2021, my team of fellow student and I worked on a optimized VIX Future Term Structure Carry Trade, that secured us a finalist spot in the prestigous South Eastern Hedge Fund Competition. Our strategy is an aggressive strategy that captures basis premiums along the VIX Futures term structure, while being hedged against tail risk. Five finalists were selected, with groups from London Business School and South Korea's Sungkyunkwan University, out of 45 initial competitors.
